## About

Boards is a app where a user can create their own Kanban Boards and customise the business logic to suit their needs depending on the problem they want to solve.
Kanban boards can be used in many different ways, The main ways I identify are:
 - Scheduling
    - This is for saying that something is happing on a particular day at a partucular time with some extra attributes depending on the requirements determines its position on the kanban
 - Task Tracking
    -   This is for saying that a particular task being tracked through a set of stages has a particular stage and status which determines its position on the kanban

The project will be built using:
-  Next.js 13
-  Tailwind.css
-  Azure Functions 
-  Node.js
-  MSSQL (NO ORMs)
